        <h2>Hi, I'm Ronald. Nice to meet you!</h2>
        <p>
          Ever since I put my hands on a computer, 17 years ago, I knew "computers" was what I wanted to do. 
          At university, I pursued a degree in Computer Science to further my knowledge into this vast field.
          With a year of internship experience, knowledge in HTML/CSS/JS, React, Python, C++/#, and more, I 
          would like to help make <em>your</em> company strive.
